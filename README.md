# Google-Image-Grabber
 A simple webscraper that downloads images from Google

If you wish to use this, you will need to have the Selenium and Colorama packages. You will also need to install Chrome and its webdriver to use this (you can see how to do this [here](https://github.com/hosua/Archive-org-scraper#prerequisites) under prerequisites). That readme is for another web-scraper I made, but contains detailed and identical instructions on how to get the webdriver. That is the only step you will need to use from there.

If you wish to use another browser, you will need to modify the code to work with it.
